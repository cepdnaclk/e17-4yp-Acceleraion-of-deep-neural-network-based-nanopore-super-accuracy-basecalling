# Acceleration of deep neural network based nanopore super accuracy basecalling
___

## Background of the project:

Nanopore sequencing is a technique that is used to real-time analyze long DNA and RNA fragments. Its work principle involves monitoring changes in an electric current passing through a protein nanopore (a nanopore is a nano-size pore or cavity) as a nucleic acid. The resulting signals can be used to identify specific DNA or RNA fragments. One of the most advantageous factors of nanopore sequencing is that it can be used to get real-time data sequencing which provides immediate access to the results.

There are challenges in the data processing or the computational analysis side of nanopore sequencing due to the large volume of data and, the amount of computational resources required. Current basecalling implementations that use GPUs take a few days. 

## Aim of the project:

The proposed project aims to accelerate the nanopore super accuracy basecalling after identifying computational bottlenecks so that basecalling can be accelerated massively.
